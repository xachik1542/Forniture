Whether you're redesigning your living room or starting from scratch in a new home, here are five key tips to elevate your space.",
        "one": {
          "name": "1. Start with a Color Palette",
          "title": "Choosing a cohesive color palette is the foundation of good design. Opt for colors that resonate with you and create the atmosphere you desire. For instance, soft neutrals like beige, white, and gray can make a room feel airy and calm, while bolder tones like navy, emerald green, or terracotta add depth and vibrancy. Consider balancing bold colors with lighter shades for a harmonious look. Use services like Color Hunt and Coolors to get color palettes.",

For example, pair a velvet sofa with a sleek glass coffee table, or place a shag rug under a minimalist wooden dining table.",

          "title": "Lighting plays a crucial role in interior design. Maximize the natural light in your space by using sheer curtains, mirrors, and lighter paint colors that reflect sunlight. If your room lacks sufficient natural light, incorporate different layers of artificial lighting, such as ambient, task, and accent lighting, to set the mood and brighten dark corners.",

For example, if you love hosting, a large sectional sofa or extendable dining table may be a good investment. If space is limited, choose furniture with hidden storage or multi-functional designs, like a coffee table that doubles as storage or a sofa bed.",
